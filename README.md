# README

Hello and welcome to the frontend of the application 'My Reading Catalog'. If you haven't already, go to the backend of this application and get your API set up and running. Visit the backend by going to this link: https://github.com/lreitzel/my-book-catalog-backend.

Great! Now, to use the frontend, if you're on Windows, you should right click on the 'index.html' file and click 'reveal in explorer'. Your file explorer will open and then you can click on the 'index' (not 'index.js') file, et voila! If you rails server is running then you should see a very flowery page with a few cards of genres and books showing!
